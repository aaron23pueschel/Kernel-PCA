# Kernel Principal Component Analysis
## (Linear and nonlinear unsupervised learning technique)

### Principle component analysis is often hailed as one of the most powerful tools used in denoising applications. One such application is in the denoising of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) signals-- a class of signals typically recorded is the posterior tibial nerve in response to a physical stimulus (usually a shock on the ankle). In classical denoising applications of SSEP signals, raw signals are often extremely noisy, and researchers are often forced to increase the number of trials in order to get a higher signal to noise ratio. Principle component analysis allows researchers to eliminate excessive sampling of the SSEP signal; a time consumning task. In this project, I implement a generalizataion of Principle Component analysis which maps data in linear space (euclidiean space) to nonlinear kernel space. Finally I test its efficacy using clinical findings .I was able to determine that KPCA, while more powerful than PCA in denoising, its benefits are marginal at best and the slightly improved SNR does not seem to justify the drawbacks of its low computational efficiency.
